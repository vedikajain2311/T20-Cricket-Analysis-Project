# T20-Cricket-Analysis-Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze T20 cricket data to identify the best players based on various performance metrics. T20 cricket is a fast-paced format of the game, and identifying top-performing players can be valuable for teams, fans, and cricket enthusiasts. The analysis includes statistical metrics such as batting average, strike rate, bowling economy rate, wicket-taking ability, and overall player impact.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed using a comprehensive dataset of T20 cricket matches and player statistics. The dataset includes information such as player name, country, matches played, runs scored, wickets taken, batting average, bowling economy rate, etc. The dataset is sourced from reliable cricket statistics repositories and is up-to-date as of [insert date].

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** The T20 cricket dataset is collected from reputable cricket statistics websites and APIs.
2. **Data Cleaning:** The collected data is cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory analysis is performed to gain insights into player performance trends, distribution of key metrics, and correlations between variables.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Additional features are derived from the dataset to enhance the analysis, such as player impact scores, player rankings, etc.
5. **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms are applied to identify top-performing players based on predefined criteria.
6. **Visualization:** Visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc., are created to present the analysis findings effectively.

## Analysis Findings
The analysis reveals insights into the following aspects:
- Top batsmen based on batting average and strike rate.
- Top bowlers based on bowling economy rate and wickets taken.
- All-rounders who excel in both batting and bowling.
- Impact players who significantly influence match outcomes.
